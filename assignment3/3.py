3. List out the difference between mutable and immutable data types.

In Python, objects are categorized as either mutable or immutable based on whether their values can be changed after creation.
Lists, dictionaries, sets.

Cannot be changed after creation: Once created, their value is fixed. Any attempt to modify them will create a new object with the updated value.
Strings, integers, floats, tuples.
